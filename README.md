# Permanent
## This is a permanent repository that I am going to keep, I will not delete this.

>### A quick explenation of what I am doing :
* W - What am I doing? Well, to answer that question, I will be putting notes every single day in my notes folder, and I am making a few website templates.
* W - Why am I doing this? Well, I am trying to learn git, javascript, and python so I am learning using this repository and contributing to another.

####If you really wish to read my notes, then you can. But they are just mostly useless daily notes. (minus on weekends.) If you wish to use my website templates, you only have to put somewhere that it was made by me. Thank you for reading, but you really didn't have to.
