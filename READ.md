These are notes I take everyday. I will not delete this... ever. If you wish to make changes, please do not delete anything. I will be okay with everything else.
My name is Khaia Alvarado, I am a homeschooling student trying to learn git and javascript. These notes will help me train myself to learn how to do these things.
W - What am I doing? Taking notes everyday.
W - When am I doing it? Everyday but, I am still 11 as of making this file.
W - Why am I doing it? To learn and practice using github and json/javascript files.
W - Where am I doing it? Well I can't tell you where but I can tell you what I'm using! I use a terminal, visual studio code, and a MacBook Air.
Yeah thanks for reading I guess. Have a great day! =^w0=
