        "By the way" : "These are useless random notes. I might make another file that would have some important medical based notes but that'll probably be next month. So, you'll have to bear with this unless you can just go to the other file right now.",
        "Manga" : "I'm an otaku... But a small one. My mom keeps me away from most anime (idk why) so I try to just watch the very 'kid-friendly' anime. I got a new manga on the last day of March! It was my very first."

            "Excercise" : "I never excercise. Do you? I heard it's good to do it way early in the morning. Like maybe 4:00am. Why? Most oxygen is out at that time and less car smog. Also, your body is warm so it's easier to stretch! I hope you like my advice."
